# C_The_Payne

Tools for interpolating spectral models with neural networks.

## Installation

Clone this repository and run code from the base directory.

    python setup.py install

The tutorial shows some simple use cases.

## Dependencies

* The spectral model and fitting routines require only Numpy and Scipy.
* Training a new neural network requires [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (GPUs required).
* All these dependencies will be automatically installed alongside with this package
* The author developed this package in Python 3.7 using Anaconda.
